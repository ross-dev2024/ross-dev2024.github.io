## Vue Router



### 入門

#### router-view

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-router@4"></script>

<div id="app">
  <h1>Hello App!</h1>
  <p>
    <!-- use the router-link component for navigation. -->
    <!-- specify the link by passing the `to` prop. -->
    <!-- `<router-link>` will render an `<a>` tag with the correct `href` attribute -->
    <router-link to="/">Go to Home</router-link>
    <router-link to="/about">Go to About</router-link>
  </p>
  <!-- route outlet -->
  <!-- component matched by the route will render here -->
  <router-view></router-view>
</div>
```



router-view will display the component that corresponds to the URL. You can put it anywhere to adapt it to your layout.



```ts
// 1. Define route components.
// These can be imported from other files
const Home = { template: '<div>Home</div>' }
const About = { template: '<div>About</div>' }

// 2. Define some routes
// Each route should map to a component.
// We'll talk about nested routes later.
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home },
  { path: '/about', component: About },
]

// 3. Create the router instance and pass the `routes` option
// You can pass in additional options here, but let's
// keep it simple for now.
const router = VueRouter.createRouter({
  // 4. Provide the history implementation to use. We are using the hash history for simplicity here.
  history: VueRouter.createWebHashHistory(),
  routes, // short for `routes: routes`
})

// 5. Create and mount the root instance.
const app = Vue.createApp({})
// Make sure to _use_ the router instance to make the
// whole app router-aware.
app.use(router)

app.mount('#app')

// Now the app has started!
```

>By calling app.use(router), we are triggering the initial navigation and giving access to this.$router as well as the current route as this.$route inside of any component:

#### access the router 


>access the router or the route inside the setup function, call the useRouter or useRoute functions. 

``` ts


// Home.vue
export default {
  computed: {
    username() {
      // We will see what `params` is shortly
      return this.$route.params.username
    },
  },
  methods: {
    goToDashboard() {
      if (isAuthenticated) {
        this.$router.push('/dashboard')
      } else {
        this.$router.push('/login')
      }
    },
  },
}
```

::: note

Keep in mind that this.$router is exactly the same as directly using the router instance created through createRouter. The reason we use this.$router is because we don't want to import the router in every single component that needs to manipulate routing.
